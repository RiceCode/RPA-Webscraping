# RPA-Webscraping
Sample code to demonstrate gathering data from non-traditional data sources. In this case, from an ocean container shipping company

There's two python files in here. 
MATS_Schedule uses "hidden" API calls to the carrier website to gather the data. 
[TBD] uses selenium to mimic a user going through a website, clicking search boxes etc to gather data.
